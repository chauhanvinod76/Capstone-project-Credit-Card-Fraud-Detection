Description of dataset

"The dataset includes credit card transactions by European cardholders in September 2013, focusing on transactions over two days. Out of 284,807 transactions, 492 are fraudulent, making up just 0.172% of the data, which highlights a significant class imbalance. 
All features, except 'Time' and 'Amount,' are numerical values obtained through PCA transformation, with the original features withheld due to confidentiality. 'Time' indicates the time elapsed since the first transaction, and 'Amount' represents the transaction amount, useful for cost-sensitive learning. 
The target variable 'Class' indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)."
